Notes on blocking function:

Freebase vs Forbes: 
- Country is always available in Forbes, sparse in Freebase (EXACT NUMBER)

Freebase vs DBPedia:
- Country is somewhat sparse in both datasets (EXACT NUMBER)
- DateFounded somewhat sparse in both (EXACT NUMBER)

Company vs Location
- Country is oly way to go

Own idea: Implement own partitioning blocker, but more fuzzy logic
- I.E. Country first, then date, then location or so as alternative (EXACT NUMBER)
- Generate more pairs, matching rule will take care if its same company or not- more conservative approach
