\section{Data fusion}
\subsection{Input data}
%Oliver
%Provenance data: only basic data: Which file did a given record originate from?
%Density: Copy paste results 
%Consistency: Copy paste results



\subsection{Gold standard}
Our fused file contains five entities and each entity involves 17 attributes.For a company the evenue, numberOfEmployees, assets, marketValue and profit are always changing over time, in oder to get the latest data, we searched for different external sources. Take APPLE for example, we went to the homepage of APPLE  to read the latest financial statement\footnote{http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/10/27Apple-Reports-Record-Fourth-Quarter-Results.html} and to get the revenue. And then went to statista\footnote{http://www.statista.com/statistics/273439/number-of-employees-of-apple-since-2005/} to acquire numberOfEmployees. And we got assets, marketValue and keyPeoplewent from Forbes\footnote{http://www.forbes.com/companies/apple/}. By comparison, Forbes offers a higher quality data than Freebase and Dbpedia. Because of the same reason, we also searched for relatively fresh data on wikipedia\footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org} for some attributes of Location, such as population, area and elevation. In a nut shell, DBpedia offers an outdated data and updating frequency is a little low.

\subsection{Conflict resolution functions}
%Oliver
%Which was tried for each attribute?
%Very often straightforward and through logical reasoning
%In the end also chose a combination of functions for some attributes
%Own definitions, also own evaluation rules
%Include stuff from integrated schema again
