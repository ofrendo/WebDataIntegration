Good blocking function?
	- Tried CrossProduct and Partitioning with countries as blocking key
	- Blocking key of attributes with null values?
	A: Use alternative as fallback
	A: Could try industries (eg banking/private banking), maybe possible to reduce it? Lots of preprocessing
	
Using RapidMiner
	- Negative coefficients?
	- Nonexistent coefficients (not much meaning?)
	- Feature selection on Linear Regression?
	A: Linear regression: Threshold is always 0.5!!
	A: F1 shouldnt be 1
Identity resolution on two classes (Company and Location)
	- With a company_id/location_id gold standard?
	A: Assign IDs to all datasets, like company_forbes_1, company_freebase_1, company_dbpedia_1, location_dbpedia_1
	A: Choose ID however we want, has to be unique for all datasets
	
	
	Conclusion: More data from Freebase, need at least 1k correspondances
