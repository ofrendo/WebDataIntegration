%Oliver
%Which attributes did we transform in which way? 
%Also: Example for each transformation showing why we did it
%DBpedia values: Very often URL
%Company and location names: Removed common strings that are inconsistent among datasets, e.g. Apple / Apple, Inc.
% 	also: Replaced punctuation and symbols like "_" or "."
%	Result example: Apple (Forbes) <-> Apple,_Inc (DBpedia)
%Countries: Replaced different spellings of same word 
%	e.g. US, USA, U.S., America with "United States of America" or UK, England with United Kingdom
%Numeric attributes to do with money: Scientific notation, small values from Forbes
%	e.g. 1.17E+10 ==> 11.700.000.000
% 	e.g. 483,1 (Apple in Forbes) ==> 483.100.000.000
