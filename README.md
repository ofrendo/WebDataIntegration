# WebDataIntegration (Group 5)
Our goal in this project is to integrate information about companies with information about cities in which their headquarters are located. The resulting dataset could then be analyzed from a data science point of view in order to find relationships, i.e. how does the population in a city correlate with the size or other attributes of companies. In order to gather more information about companies, we first combine several datasets together, all of which are about companies but derived from different sources. We then integrate this result with the data about locations.
